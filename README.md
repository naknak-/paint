This Bash script applies ANSI escape-sequence colors and effects to terminal text, using grep's coloring facilities and a table of friendly names.

**To install**, download `paint` and place it in the PATH.   

Put `export=DARK=1` in your `.bashrc` to use dark mode (selecting dark versions of macros, when available).

This is built to work with `mintty` but most terminal programs will support the colors and maybe some of the effects.  Invoke `paint` without arguments to see how things look on your terminal.
