This Bash script applies ANSI escape-sequence colors and effects to terminal text, using grep's coloring facilities and a table of friendly names.

To install, download `paint` and place it in the PATH.   The only dependencies are `grep` and `tr`.

It's intended to work with `mintty` but most terminal programs will support the colors and maybe some of the effects.  Invoke `paint` without arguments to see how things look on your terminal.
